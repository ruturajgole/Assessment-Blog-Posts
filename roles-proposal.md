# Roles Proposal

## What database changes would be required to the starter code to allow for different roles for authors of a blog post? Imagine that weâ€™d want to also be able to add custom roles and change the permission sets for certain roles on the fly without any code changes.

We'd introduce a new table called roles with two columns - **role_name and role_permission** (r, w, rw, rwd, null).

`id  role_name role_permission`
`1   owner     rwd`
`2   editor    rw`
`3   viewer    r`

The id for this table would be a foreign key in the user_post table.
If there doesn't exist a row for a post_id, then the role_id for that row would be by default 1 (owner).

`id  post_id   user_id   role_id`
`5   3         9         1`

Class Role would contain a method to retrieve the role and its permissions by name. 

Class Role could be initialized by passing the role_name and role_permission, and it would create a new role if it doesn't exist. 

## How would you have to change the PATCH route given your answer above to handle roles?

At `/api/posts`, `PATCH` would allow to modify the type of role that a person has, so the response could look like the following:

```bash
{
  "post": {
    "id": 1,  # number
    "authorIds": [1, 5],  # array of numbers
    "roleId": 1 # number
    "role_name": "owner", # string (Included in the response object, not in the Post class)
    "likes": 960,  # number
    "popularity": 0.13,  # number
    "reads": 50361,  # number
    "tags": ["health", "tech"],  # array of strings
    "text": "Some very short blog post text here."  # string
  }
}
```
